## Introduction

This tutorial is designed for individuals with a basic understanding of cloud concepts and who are interested in learning how to set up a virtual machine (VM) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and deploy an Nginx web server. We will go step-by-step through the process, emphasizing best practices and troubleshooting.

## Method

- We will use the GCP web console to manually provision a VM running the Linux distribution Debian as Operating System (OS)
- We will deploy an Nginx web server by using the Debian package manager running commands in a terminal.
- We will use the web based terminal provided by the GCP Console to access the server

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account. If you don't have one, sign up [here](https://cloud.google.com/).
- Basic knowledge of cloud computing and familiarity with command-line interfaces (CLI).

## Provision a Virtual Machine

1. Log into Google Cloud Console
	- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
	- Log in using your Google account.

2. Create a New Project
	- In the console, go to the project selector page.
	- Click on "New Project" and enter a project name and billing details.

3. Creating the VM Instance
	- Navigate to the "Compute Engine" > "VM Instances".
	- Click "Create Instance".
	- Name your instance and select a region and zone.
	- Choose a machine type (cheapest).
	- Under 'Boot disk', click 'Change', select the operating system (e.g., Debian) and click 'Select'.
	- Open port 80 for HTTP traffic
	- Click "Create" to provision the VM.

## Deploy Nginx

1. Accessing the VM
	- Once the VM is set up, click on "SSH" in the VM instances page to open a terminal in the browser.

2. Install Nginx
	- Update your package lists: `sudo apt-get update`
	- Install Nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx`

## Verify the Installation

- Access your new server by browsing to the external IP of your VM, displayed in the VM instances page. You should see the Nginx welcome page.

## Additional Configuration (Optional)

- You can customize the served content from your Nginx server by editing the index file:
	`sudo nano /var/www/...`

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues accessing your server, ensure your VM's firewall rules allow HTTP traffic.
- Verify that Nginx is running: 
	`systemctl status nginx`

## Final Thoughts

Limitations: 
- The content is served unencrypted on HTTP
- The provisioning and deployment is done manually. No automation is applied.
- Access to the VM is done through the built-in web based terminal in the GCP console, which means you need access to the GCP platform in order to access the VM

Next Steps:
- Use gcloud (CLI) to provision the VM
