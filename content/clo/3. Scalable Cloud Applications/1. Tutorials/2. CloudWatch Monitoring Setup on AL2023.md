## 🎯 Goal

Set up comprehensive monitoring for an EC2 instance running nginx by implementing CloudWatch Agent to collect system metrics and application logs.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before beginning this exercise, you should:

- Have an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023
- Understand basic IAM concepts (roles and policies)
- Be familiar with SSH and Linux command line
- Have basic knowledge of web servers (nginx)

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

- Configure **IAM roles** with proper permissions for CloudWatch and Systems Manager
- Install and configure **CloudWatch Agent** to collect metrics and logs
- Use **Systems Manager Parameter Store** to centrally manage agent configuration
- Create a **CloudWatch Dashboard** to visualize system and application metrics
- Understand the difference between **default EC2 metrics** and custom CloudWatch Agent metrics

## 📝 Why This Matters

In real-world applications, monitoring is crucial because:

- It enables proactive issue detection before customers are affected
- It's essential for troubleshooting production incidents
- CloudWatch is AWS's native monitoring solution, making it the standard for AWS workloads
- Understanding IAM permissions for monitoring is critical for security

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Configure IAM Role for Your EC2 Instance

First, create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for CloudWatch Agent.

1. Navigate to **IAM Console** → **Roles** → **Create role**
2. Select **AWS service** → **EC2** → **Next**
3. Search and attach this AWS managed policy: `CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy`
4. Name the role: `CloudWatch-Agent-Role`
5. Attach the role to your EC2 instance:
   - EC2 Console → Select instance → Actions → Security → Modify IAM role

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **CloudWatchAgentAdminPolicy**: Allows the agent to write metrics and logs to CloudWatch
> - Without SSM permissions, you cannot store configurations centrally or use the `ssm:` prefix
>
> ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**
>
> - Forgetting SSM permissions causes "Access Denied" when saving to Parameter Store
> - Not attaching the role to EC2 means no metrics will appear in CloudWatch

You might need to setup your own policy to be able to write to Systems Manager

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowWriteCloudWatchAgentConfigToSSM",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ssm:PutParameter",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:*:*:parameter/AmazonCloudWatch-*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 2: Install Nginx and CloudWatch Agent

1. SSH into your EC2 instance
2. Install nginx as our sample application:

   ```bash
   # Update system and install nginx
   sudo dnf update -y
   sudo dnf install nginx -y
   
   # Start nginx
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   
   # Create a test page
   echo "<h1>CloudWatch Test</h1>" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
   ```

3. Download and install CloudWatch Agent:

   ```bash
   # Download the agent
   wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/amazon_linux/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
   
   # Install it
   sudo rpm -U ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.rpm
   ```

4. Install CollectD:

   ```bash
   # Install CollectD
   sudo dnf install collectd -y
   ```

5. Amazon Linux 2023 uses journald for logging. In order to get the logs to the traditional files you need to install RSyslog.

    ```bash
    # Install and activate rsyslog
    sudo dnf install rsyslog -y
    sudo systemctl start rsyslog
    sudo systemctl enable rsyslog

    # Configure SSH to log to traditional files
    echo "SyslogFacility AUTH" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    echo "LogLevel INFO" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Restart sshd
    sudo systemctl restart sshd
    ```

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **Package Installation**: The RPM creates a `cwagent` user and installs files in `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/`
> - You needed to install CollectD.
> - The agent can collect both AWS service metrics and custom application metrics
>
> Now you will have the logs here:
>
> - Nginx: /var/log/nginx/access.log
> - SSH: /var/log/secure
> - System: /var/log/messages

### Step 3: Configure CloudWatch Agent Using the Wizard

1. Run the configuration wizard:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
   ```

2. Select these options in the wizard:

   ```text
   OS:                     1 (linux)
   EC2 or On-Premises:     1 (EC2)
   User:                   2 (root)
   StatsD:                 2 (no)
   CollectD:               1 (yes)
   Host metrics:           1 (yes)
   CPU per core:           2 (no)
   EC2 dimensions:         1 (yes)
   Collection interval:    4 (60s)
   Metrics level:          2 (Standard)
   Satisfied:              1 (yes)
   Import existing config: 2 (no)
   Monitor log files:      1 (yes)
   ```

3. Configure Nginx access log as source:

   ```text
   Nginx log:
     File path:   /var/log/nginx/access.log
     Group name:  access.log
     Stream name: {instance_id}
     Add another: 2 (no)
   ```

4. Save to Parameter Store:

   ```text
   Store in Parameter Store: 1 (yes)
   Parameter name:          AmazonCloudWatch-linux
   Region:                  [press Enter]
   Credentials:             1 (use IAM role)
   ```

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **Standard Metrics**: Includes CPU, memory, disk, and swap usage
> - **Log Groups**: Organize different log types for easier querying
> - **Parameter Store**: Enables centralized configuration management across multiple instances

### Step 4: Start the CloudWatch Agent

1. Alt 1: Start the agent using the Parameter Store configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
       -a fetch-config \
       -m ec2 \
       -s \
       -c ssm:AmazonCloudWatch-al2023
   ```

2. Alt 2: Start the agent using the local configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
       -a fetch-config \
       -m ec2 \
       -s \
       -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json
   ```

3. Verify it's running:

   ```bash
   # Check status
   sudo systemctl status amazon-cloudwatch-agent
   
   # View logs if there are issues
   sudo tail -f /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log
   ```

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **fetch-config**: Downloads and applies the configuration
> - **-m ec2**: Uses EC2 metadata for instance information
> - **-s**: Starts the agent after configuration
> - **ssm: prefix**: Fetches config from Parameter Store (requires SSM permissions)
>
> ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**
>
> - Using `ssm:` without SSM permissions will fail with "Access Denied"
> - The agent needs 2-5 minutes before metrics appear in CloudWatch

### Step 5: Create CloudWatch Dashboard

1. Navigate to **CloudWatch Console** → **Dashboards** → **Create dashboard**
2. Name: `test`
3. Add four widgets:

   **Widget 1 - CPU:**

   - Type: Number
   - Metrics → EC2 → Per-Instance Metrics
   - Select: CPUUtilization

   **Widget 2 - Memory:**

   - Type: Number  
   - Metrics → CWAgent → Select your instance
   - Select: mem_used_percent

   **Widget 3 - Disk:**

   - Type: Number
   - Metrics → CWAgent → Select your instance
   - Select: disk_used_percent

   **Widget 4 - System Logs:**

   - Type: Logs table
   - Log group: access.log
   - Query: `fields @timestamp, @message | sort @timestamp desc | limit 10`

4. Save the dashboard

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **EC2 Namespace**: Contains default metrics (CPU only, no agent needed)
> - **CWAgent Namespace**: Contains custom metrics from CloudWatch Agent
> - Metrics may take 5 minutes to appear after agent startup

## 🧪 Final Tests

### Run the Application and Validate Your Work

1. Generate test data:

   ```bash
   # Install stress tool
   sudo dnf install -y stress-ng
   
   # Generate CPU load
   sudo stress-ng --cpu 2 --timeout 30s
   
   # Generate nginx traffic
   for i in {1..20}; do curl localhost; done
   
   # Create log entries
   logger -t TEST "CloudWatch monitoring test"
   ```

2. Open CloudWatch Dashboard and verify:
   - CPU utilization increases during stress test
   - Memory and disk percentages are displayed
   - System logs show your test message
   - Nginx access logs appear (if configured)

✅ **Expected Results**

- All three number widgets display percentage values
- CPU shows spike during stress test (may take 1-2 minutes)
- Logs table shows recent system messages
- No error messages in agent logs

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **No metrics appearing**: Check IAM role has both required policies
- **SSM errors**: Ensure `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy is attached
- **Agent won't start**: Review logs at `/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/`
- **Missing CWAgent namespace**: Wait 5 minutes, then restart agent
