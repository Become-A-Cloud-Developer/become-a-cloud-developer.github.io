## Introduction

This tutorial will walk you through setting up a new S3 bucket hosting a simple `index.html` page and integrating it with Amazon CloudFront for secure and optimized content delivery. By the end of this guide, youâ€™ll have a CloudFront distribution configured with an S3 origin and secured with HTTPS.

## Prerequisites

- An active AWS account

## Step 1: Develop a Simple Web Page

1. **Create an `index.html` file with the following content:**

    > `index.html`

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My CloudFront Example</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to my CloudFront-secured website!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>

2.  **Verify**

    Use your web browser and go to `file://<path>/index.html`


## Step 2: Set Up S3 for Static Website Hosting

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**
    - Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click "Create bucket"
        - Bucket name: `cloudfrontdemo<date><time>` (The bucket name must be unique)
        - Click "Create bucket"

2. **Upload the Web Page**
    - Upload the `index.html` file to your S3 bucket.

## Step 3: Create a CloudFront Distribution

1. **Set Up CloudFront**

    - Navigate to the **CloudFront** service in the AWS Management Console.
    - Click **Create Distribution**
        - **Origin Domain**: Select your S3 bucket from the dropdown.
        - **Origin access**: Select _Origin access control settings_
        - Press the button **Create new OAC**
        - In the popup keep default values and press **Create**
        - **Viewer protocol policy**: Select _Redirect HTTP to HTTPS_
        - **WAF**: Select _Do not enable security protections_
        - **Default root object**: Enter _index.html_
        - Click **Create Distribution** 
        
    Wait for the status to change from **Deploying** to **Date**. This may take a few minutes.

2. **Adjust the policy of the S3 bucket to allow ClodFront access**

    - In the yellow banner click **Copy Policy**
    - Follow the link in the banner to get to your S3 Bucket
    - Navigate to the **Permissions** tab
        - Edit the **Bucket Policy**
        - Paste in the policy
        - **Save Changes**
    
## Step 4: Verify Your CloudFront Distribution

1. Once deployed, copy the **Domain Name** of your CloudFront distribution (e.g., `d123abc456.cloudfront.net`).
2. Open this domain in your web browser. You should see your `index.html` page served securely via CloudFront.
3. Try to use http as well. What happens?

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully set up an S3 bucket with `index.html` as the origin for CloudFront. Your content is now served with lower latency, secure HTTPS, and scalability benefits provided by CloudFront.

# Happy Secure Surfing on AWS! ðŸš€
